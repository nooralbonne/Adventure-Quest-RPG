# Adventure Quest RPG

## Overview
Adventure Quest RPG is a console-based role-playing game where players explore different locations, battle monsters, and collect items. The game features a variety of monsters, including powerful boss monsters, and allows players to manage their inventory and equip items to enhance their abilities.

## Features
- **Player and Monster Battles**: Engage in turn-based combat with various monsters.
- **Boss Monsters**: Face challenging boss monsters with high stats.
- **Inventory System**: Collect and manage items like weapons, armor, and potions.
- **Exploration**: Discover new locations and choose your actions.

## Battle Mechanics

### Attributes
- **Name**: The name of the character or monster.
- **Health**: Represents the current health points. When it reaches zero, the character or monster is defeated.
- **AttackPower**: Determines the amount of damage dealt to an opponent.
- **Defense**: Reduces the damage received from an opponentâ€™s attack.

### Battle Process
1. **Initiation**: A battle begins when the player encounters a monster.
2. **Turns**: Battles are turn-based. The player and the monster take turns to attack each other.
3. **Attack Calculation**: 
   - The damage dealt during an attack is calculated as: `Damage = AttackPower - Defense`.
   - If `Defense` is greater than or equal to `AttackPower`, the minimum damage dealt is 1.
4. **Health Reduction**: The calculated damage is subtracted from the defender's `Health`.
5. **Defeat**: If a character or monster's `Health` reaches zero, they are defeated.
